In a Leaflet popup you can just write plain HTML with anything you want. So instead of writing

layer.bindPopup(feature.properties.name);

you could simply write

layer.bindPopup('<h1>'+feature.properties.name+'</h1><p>Language: '+feature.properties.language+'</p>');

If you would like to display automatically all properties as a table inside the popup window, you could build up your HTML dynamically, something like:

var popupContent = '<table>';
for (var p in feature.properties) {
    popupContent += '<tr><td>' + p + '</td><td>'+ feature.properties[p] + '</td></tr>';
}
popupContent += '</table>';
layer.bindPopup(popupContent);










            function onEachFeature(feature, layer) {
                layer.bindPopup(feature.properties.popupContent);
